##  Optimization Workflow

To ensure the Medical Assistant AMR can recognize medications in real-time with minimal latency, I implemented a systematic optimization pipeline:

### 1. Model Training & Preparation
* **Architecture:** Trained a custom **YOLOv11** model specifically for medical items (medicine boxes, pill bottles, and medical tools).
* **Dataset:** Curated a high-quality dataset with medical-grade labels.
* **Export:** Converted the baseline PyTorch model (`.pt`) to the OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format.

### 2. INT8 Quantization 
To maximize throughput on edge hardware, I applied **INT8 Quantization** using the OpenVINO NNCF (Neural Network Compression Framework):
* **Goal:** Reduce model precision from FP32 to INT8 to decrease memory bandwidth and speed up computation.
* **Result:** Achieved a **~54% reduction** in latency with a negligible accuracy drop (only **0.48%**).

### 3. Hardware Acceleration (iGPU Offloading)
Most standard laptops/AMR controllers struggle with CPU-only inference. I optimized the system to offload the heavy AI workload to the **Intel® UHD Graphics 630 (iGPU)**

### 4. Performance Validation
I utilized a dual-metric validation approach:
* **Accuracy Check:** Running `model.val()` on the dedicated validation set to ensure medicine detection remains reliable.
* **Hardware Benchmark:** Using the Intel `benchmark_app` to measure the "Raw Power" of the iGPU, ensuring a stable **~44.43 FPS** across different lighting conditions.
